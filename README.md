# ControlPendulum
Learning classical control theory with a practical implementation of two types of Pendulums - [Aerothrust Pendulum](http://aeropendulum.arizona.edu/), and [Inverted Pendulum](http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?example=BallBeam&section=SystemModeling) 

### AeroThrust Pendulum
PID controller implementation of AeroThrust Pendulum was done in arduino for real-time.
Experiment/ Simulations for Parameter Identification and System Modeling was done in matlab for PID Controller design.
Bode Plot Analysis and Lead/Lag Compensator Designs soon to be updated.

### Inverted Pendulum
System Modelling and Analysis was done in Matlab.
A complete Inverted Pendulum system model and the closed loop PID Controller was designed using Simulink.
