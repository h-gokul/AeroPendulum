# AeroPendulum
Learning classical control theory with a practical implementation - [Aerothrust Pendulum](http://aeropendulum.arizona.edu/), a project based on University of Arizona's associate professor Dr. Eniko T. Enikov

PID controller implementation was done in arduino.
Experiment/ Simulations for Parameter Identification and System Modeling was done in matlab for PID Controllers .

Bode Plot Analysis and Lead/Lag Compensator Designs soon to be updated.
