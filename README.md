# AeroPendulum
Learning classical control theory with a practical implementation - [Aerothrust Pendulum](http://aeropendulum.arizona.edu/), a project based on University of Arizona's associate professor Dr. Eniko T. Enikov

PID controller implementation was done in arduino.

Matlab implementations soon to be updated.
